**Overview.** This combined advanced undergraduate and graduate course will introduce students to constructive logic and its uses for specification and verification of formal languages, including logics and programming languages, and of software systems, more generally. Using contructive logic as a *logical framework* in which to embed specifications of other languages and systems has proven to be valuable in the production of high assurance software systems,  from compilers that provably generate correct machine code, to microprocessors that provably have certain critical correctness properties, to drones that are provably immune to specific kinds of security attacks. 

**Prerequisites.** The course is open to advanced undergraduates who have take at least one course in theoretical computer science (algorithms, theory of computing, or CS 2102 as taught by Sullivan), or with permission of the instructor. 

**Learning Objectives.** Students who take this course will come to understand advanced functional programming, higher-order logic and ordinary predicate logic, programming logics, the essential features of imperative programming languages, and recent efforts to formalize mathematics. The course uses the Lean Prover as an interactive proof assistant and as programming language in which types, propositions, and proofs are just other forms of data.  

**Reading.** Baanen, Bentkamp, Blanchette, Holzel, and Limperg, [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification*](https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2020/blob/master/hitchhikers_guide.pdf), Standard Edition, available online, Oct 12, 2020.

**Background Reading.** M. Lipovaca, [*Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!*](http://learnyouahaskell.com), No Starch Press, 2011. Read through Chapter 6, Section 4, *Lambdas*.

**Grading.** Course grades will be based on eight or so homework assignments; a semester project (tentative); and two exams. 

**Schedule.** Roughly speaking we will cover material drawn from about one chapter each week. Here are the section and chapter assignments by date, along with dates reserved for reviews and exams.
